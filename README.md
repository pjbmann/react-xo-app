## Here I try to incorporate Tic-Tac-Toe app react code from React official tutorial into create-react-app template, to study basic of react template structure.

Here's the link to Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial.

Since I was new to React, I was trying to understand React from the mentioned tutorial on the official site of React, all was good until then I was wondering, "where are these codes should be placed in the actual React structured app?" Since it's not html, which you can run directly with a browser.

So I Google'd and then came across this W3school tutorial.
